## R Questions

```{r}
# change this once assignment link is updated
address <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vrose99/Assignment7temp/main/shhs.txt"
raw_data <- read.csv(address)

# linear regression
# should this be lm(log(rdi4p + 1)~bmi+1
linear_Model1 = lm(log(rdi4p + 1)~bmi, data = raw_data)

# Report the coefficients and a scatterplot with the fitted line.
# NEED TO REPORT THE COEFFICIENTS!!! from above model

# scatterplot:
ggplot(raw_data, aes(x=bmi, y=log(1+ rdi4p))) +
  geom_point(size=2, shape=18, color="blue", alpha=0.4) + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm', se = "FALSE") # for some reason it's not showing up well

# need to predict for bmi of 30 (just math using number from above)
# predict(linear_Model1, 30) # not actually this but similar

# need to write little about mean and intercept of coefficients (can do this later)

```
```{r}
# Squared Error Loss
linear_Model2 = lm(log(rdi4p + 1)~bmi + waist + age + sex, raw_data)
